# Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics
This project I created for Data minning course at my faculty in summer semester of 2020 using R. Elements of the data dictionary describe San Francisco International Airport (SFO)
passenger statistical data. The purpose of this project was to see the correlation of the variable GEO.Summary with other factors of this airport.
